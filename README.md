# Image Processing
Repository created to gather some of the algorithms written for the "Image Processing" course at the ICMC - University of SÃ£o Paulo in 2019.


## First Assignment
In this assignment an image generator was implemented using different mathematical functions.

## Second Assignment
For this assignment, different filters were implemented to be applied to images for their enhancement (using only numpy and ImageIO).
- Limiarization 
- 1D filtering
- 2D filtering with limiarization
- 2D median filter

## Third Assignment
In this assignment, the following techniques were implemented for image restoration using only scipy and numpy:
- Adaptive Denoising
- Constrained Least Squares Filtering (deblurring)

## Fourth Assignment
For this assignment, a K-means algorithm was implemented for color image segmentation using only numpy, random and ImageIO.
